# Calculator using DOM 

I have create a Calculator using DOM.\
I used Keyboard and mouse events for numbers. \
When any keys pressed other than number keys it shows an alert warning "Only numbers are allowed".\
I added functions to perform addition, subtraction, division, multiplication and modulus. \
