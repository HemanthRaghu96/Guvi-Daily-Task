# Pokemon card genertor

I implement the pokemon card genertor using fetch() API.\
I use https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ to get data.\
I used Bootstrap cards to display the necessary data on the screen.
I displayed the images in a Card and it display pokemon HP,Image,Name,Attack,Defence,Speed.\
I have used HYML,JS,CSS,bootstrap for styling.\
My Pokemon card genertor app is responsive can use in small to large phone,tablet,laptop and desktop.
