# Random Joke Generator

I implement the Random Joke Generator using fetch() API.\
I use https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any?blacklistFlags=nsfw,religious,political,racist,sexist,explicit&type=single to get data.\
I used Bootstrap cards to display the necessary data on the screen.\
I have used HYML,JS,CSS,bootstrap for styling.\
My Random Joke Generator app is responsive can use in small to large phone,tablet,laptop and desktop.
