# Image Gallery

I implement the Image Gallery using fetch() API.\
I use https://api.pexels.com/ to get data.\
I used Bootstrap cards to display the necessary data on the screen.\
I also created searchbar so user can get the result according to there search.\
I displayed the images in a grid.\
I have used HYML,JS,CSS,bootstrap for styling.\
My Image Gallery is responsive can use in small to large phone,tablet,laptop and desktop.
