# Restcountries & Weather using fetch API

I implement the rest countries and Open weather map APIs using fetch() API.\
I used fetch() API to get both rest countries' data and open weather.\
I used Bootstrap cards to display the necessary data on the screen.\
I displayed the below values in the Bootstrap card,Capital, Lating, Flag, Afghanistan, Region, Name, Aland Islands, Country codes.\
I have used React JSX for design and functionality ,bootstrap for styling.\
My Restcountries & Weather app is responsive can use in small to large phone,tablet,laptop and desktop.
